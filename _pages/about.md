Hi! This site represents my online portfolio. It's an extended version of my [resume](https://github.com/mikedewar/resume/blob/master/README.md).

# Product Focused Data Science

I build products based on algorithms, powered by data. I bring advanced techniques from data science together with mission-driven experts in order to build next generation products in novel domains.

# Selected Projects and Outcomes

**Behavioural Modelling using Payments Data** (London 2016 onwards)

At Vocalink/Mastercard
my team and I built products and services based on the bank-to-bank (ACH) payments that
Mastercard processes. The majority of this work involved behavioural modelling aimed
at detecting network wide fraud and money laundering, using techniques from across data science.

This work is targeted at the development of country-scale products and has resulted in three
major products: a consumer scam detection service running over real time payments systems, a corporate
fraud detection service for batch payment systems, and a money mule focused anti-money laundering
service for the real time payments systems.

Over this period, I grew the team from 5 people to 35
at it is peak; it has since been split apart and re-formed in Mastercard's standard org structure, where the
new separate teams continue to receive investment.

- **Consumer Fraud Risk**: Financial Crime Solutions, Mastercard.
  2022-. Consumer Fraud Risk provides a pre-payment API to detect scams on bank to bank payments. The Bloomberg article above describes
  the product my team and I developed, built and deployed in the years up to 2022. It is used by the major UK banks, with TSB estimating the service
  will save the UK economy £100M per year.
  - Awards:
    - Consumer Anti-Fraud Solution of the Year - Payments Awards 2023
    - Best Security or Anti-Fraud Development - The Card and Payments Awards 2024

- **Trace Financial Crime**: Financial Crime Solutions, Mastercard.
  2016-. Trace detects money laundering over instant payments networks. This report
  details a study my team and I executed in 2016, which we subsequently turned into a working
  product over the course of 2017 used by the 13 largest banks in the UK, covering well over 90%
  of the UK bank to bank payments. This went live in October 2018.

    - [Vocalink](https://www.vocalink.com/news-insights/case-studies/case-study-mits/)
- **Corporate Fraud Insights**: Vocalink Analytics. 2016-. Corporate Fraud Insights detects fraud in the Bacs payment network in the UK. The Times article above describes how Vocalink Analytics, working with RBS, prevented over £7MM of losses to RBS's customers in less than two year's worth of operation. My team and I built the behavioural modelling, scoring mechanism and application layer wrapper to deliver this service.

**Realtime Monitoring of Web-based Systems** (New York 2011 to 2016)

My work at bitly and The New York Times involved finding and exposing value
in the data assets collected through the behaviour of large online media
audiences. This work was highly varied, involving one-off analysis
projects, product prototyping, infrastructure development, and tool
building. My work focused mainly on online event stream processing
applications, the dominant online data structure.

- **Streamtools: https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools** NYT R&D.
  2014-2015. Streamtools is an open source, graphical toolkit for
  dealing with live streams of data. Its aim was to allow analysts and
  designers build algorithms that work directly on a stream of data,
  rather than performing offline processing at a later date.

- **Bitly Science: https://bitlyscience.github.io/** Bitly Science
  Team. 2011-2012. This website showcases a number of blog posts and
  magazine articles created using analysis from the bitly science
  team. My role was been to do the analysis for a number of posts, as
  well as work with teams in the mainstream media, most notably The
  Guardian and Scientific American.

**Prototyping Future Media** (New York 2013-2016)

A lot of my work at the New York Times involved contributing to the speculative prototyping work the lab performed. Specifically I contributed to

- **[editor](http://nytlabs.com/projects/editor.html)** NYT R\&D. 2014-2015. A prototype text editor that uses a recurrent neural network to perform semi-automated tagging of sub-sentence blocks of text.
- **[lazarus](http://nytlabs.com/projects/lazarus.html)** NYT R\&D. 2013-2014. A system that uses some basic machine vision techniques to associate a photo from the physical archive with its digital counterpart in the NYT's digital archive.
- **[colony](https://github.com/nytlabs/colony)** NYT R\&D. 2014. A microservice messaging framework for NSQ (http://nsq.io/). Colony was used to explore what kind of systems are afforded by distributed computation and deployment.

**Spatiotemporal Modelling** (Sheffield, Edinburgh, New York
2003-2011)

This project began with my PhD Thesis, which was focused on
learning linear dynamic models from spatiotemporal data. The main focus
of this work was learning models which are interpretable in terms of the
underlying system. My work has been followed up on in two main projects:
neural field modelling and an analysis of the Afghanistan Wikileaks data
set.

work, the Edinburgh portion of which resulted in a successful startup
called Actual Analytics, sought to automate routine animal behavioural
