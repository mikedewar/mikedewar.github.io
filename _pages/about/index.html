The majority of this work involved behavioural modelling aimed at detecting network wide fraud and money laundering, using techniques from across data science.</p> <p>This work is targeted at the development of country-scale products and has resulted in three major products: a consumer scam detection service running over real time payments systems, a corporate fraud detection service for batch payment systems, and a money mule focused anti-money laundering service for the real time payments systems.</p> <p>Over this period, I grew the team from 5 people to 35 at it is peak; it has since been split apart and re-formed in Mastercard’s standard org structure, where the new separate teams continue to receive investment.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Consumer Fraud Risk</strong>: Financial Crime Solutions, Mastercard. 2022-. Consumer Fraud Risk provides a pre-payment API to detect scams on bank to bank payments. The Bloomberg article above describes the product my team and I developed, built and deployed in the years up to 2022. It is used by the major UK banks, with TSB estimating the service will save the UK economy £100M per year. <ul> <li>Awards: <ul> <li>Consumer Anti-Fraud Solution of the Year - Payments Awards 2023</li> <li>Best Security or Anti-Fraud Development - The Card and Payments Awards 2024</li> </ul> </li> <li>Coverage: <ul> <li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/mastercard-s-ai-tool-helps-nine-british-banks-tackle-scams" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Trace Financial Crime</strong>: Financial Crime Solutions, Mastercard. 2016-. Trace detects money laundering over instant payments networks. This report details a study my team and I executed in 2016, which we subsequently turned into a working product over the course of 2017 used by the 13 largest banks in the UK, covering well over 90% of the UK bank to bank payments. This went live in October 2018. <ul> <li>Awards <ul> <li>Rising Star Award - Deloitte Market Gravity Awards 2018</li> </ul> </li> <li>Coverage <ul> <li><a href="https://www.future-fis.com/uploads/3/7/9/4/3794525/ffis_-_payments_policy_discussion_paper_1_-_unleashing_the_potential_of_payments_infrastructure_to_identify_economic_crime_risk.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Royal United Services Institute (RUSI)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.vocalink.com/news-insights/case-studies/case-study-mits/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vocalink</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Corporate Fraud Insights</strong>: Vocalink Analytics. 2016-. Corporate Fraud Insights detects fraud in the Bacs payment network in the UK. The Times article above describes how Vocalink Analytics, working with RBS, prevented over £7MM of losses to RBS’s customers in less than two year’s worth of operation. My team and I built the behavioural modelling, scoring mechanism and application layer wrapper to deliver this service. <ul> <li>Awards <ul> <li>Banking Security Innovation of the Year - Retail Banker International Awards 2018</li> <li>Analytics Project of the Year - National Technology Awards 2018</li> <li>Best Security or Anti-Fraud Development - The UK Card &amp; Payments Award 2019</li> </ul> </li> <li>Coverage <ul> <li><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rbs-system-pushes-back-against-invoice-fraudsters-88h92l5ml" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Times</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Realtime Monitoring of Web-based Systems</strong> (New York 2011 to 2016)</p> <p>My work at bitly and The New York Times involved finding and exposing value in the data assets collected through the behaviour of large online media audiences. This work was highly varied, involving one-off analysis projects, product prototyping, infrastructure development, and tool building. My work focused mainly on online event stream processing applications, the dominant online data structure.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Streamtools: https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools</strong> NYT R&amp;D. 2014-2015. Streamtools is an open source, graphical toolkit for dealing with live streams of data. Its aim was to allow analysts and designers build algorithms that work directly on a stream of data, rather than performing offline processing at a later date.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bitly Science: https://bitlyscience.github.io/</strong> Bitly Science Team. 2011-2012. This website showcases a number of blog posts and magazine articles created using analysis from the bitly science team. My role was been to do the analysis for a number of posts, as well as work with teams in the mainstream media, most notably The Guardian and Scientific American.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Prototyping Future Media</strong> (New York 2013-2016)</p> <p>A lot of my work at the New York Times involved contributing to the speculative prototyping work the lab performed. Specifically I contributed to</p> <ul> <li> <strong><a href="http://nytlabs.com/projects/editor.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">editor</a></strong> NYT R\&amp;D. 2014-2015.

Colony was used to explore what kind of systems are afforded by distributed computation and deployment.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Spatiotemporal Modelling</strong> (Sheffield, Edinburgh, New York 2003-2011)</p> <p>This project began with my PhD Thesis, which was focused on learning linear dynamic models from spatiotemporal data. The main focus of this work was learning models which are interpretable in terms of the underlying system. My work has been followed up on in two main projects: neural field modelling and an analysis of the Afghanistan Wikileaks data set.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Point process modelling of the Afghan War Diary</strong>, Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Michael Dewar, Visakan Kadirkamanathan, and Guido Sanguinetti.
